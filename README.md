# SRIM-nix
Declarative packaging for SRIM (The Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter - https://www.srim.org/) using nix flakes + wineWrap by lucasew (https://github.com/lucasew/nixcfg/blob/e542e743774f499f996a4f886a8d4a4133fce258/packages/wrapWine.nix). Can be used standalone via nix build or as a package via flake input in NixOS configuration. Since it's packaged with nix, it will just work!
